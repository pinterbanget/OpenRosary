        <item>Reading: Luke 1:26-38 (ESV)\n\nIn the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin\'s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, \"Greetings, favored one, the Lord is with you!\" But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.\" And Mary said to the angel, \"How will this be, since I am a virgin?\" And the angel answered her, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holyâ€”the Son of God. And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.\" And Mary said, \"Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.\" And the angel departed from her.</item>
        <item>Reading: Luke 1:39-45 (ESV)\n\nIn those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she exclaimed with a loud cry, \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\"</item>
        <item>Reading: Luke 2:1-7 (ESV)\n\nIn those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be registered, each to his own town. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</item>
        <item>Reading: Luke 2:22-38 (ESV)\n\nAnd when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, \"Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord\") and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, \"a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.\" Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord\'s Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, \"Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.\" And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him. And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, \"Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.\" And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin, and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.</item>
        <item>Reading: Luke 2:41-52 (ESV)\n\nNow his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom. And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, but supposing him to be in the group they went a day\'s journey, but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances, and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, \"Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.\" And he said to them, \"Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father\'s house?\" And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them. And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.</item>

And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\"</item>

When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, \"They have no wine.\" And Jesus said to her, \"Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.\" His mother said to the servants, \"Do whatever he tells you.\" Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, \"Fill the jars with water.\" And they filled them up to the brim. And he said to them, \"Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.\" So they took it. When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, \"Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine.

And Peter said to Jesus, \"Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.\" When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, \"Rise, and have no fear.\" And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</item>
        <item>Reading: Matthew 26:26-28 (ESV)\n\nNow as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, \"Take, eat; this is my body.\" And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, \"Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.\"</item>

Then he said to them, \"My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.\" And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, \"My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.\" And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, \"So, could you not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" Again for the second time he went away and prayed, \"My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.\" And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. Then he came to the disciples and said to them, \"Sleep and take your rest later on.

For behold, the days are coming when they will say, \'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!\' Then they will begin to say to the mountains,\'Fall on us,\' and to the hills, \'Cover us.\' For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?\"</item>
